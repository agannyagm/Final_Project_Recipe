        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour – plain flour – maida</li>
            <li>1-1/2 tablespoons oil</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>About 1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup moong dal</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ginger chopped</li>
            <li>1 green chili chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fennel seeds powder- saunf</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds – jeera</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon mango powder – amchoor</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon asafetida – hing</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In a bowl mix the flour, salt and oil together. Add the water slowly, mixing with your fingers as you pour. Dough should be firm and smooth. I used about half cup of water. Knead the dough lightly. Cover the dough and let it sit for at least fifteen minutes.</li>
            <li>Wash and soak dal for at least four hours. Drain the water and blend dal, with ginger, and green chili to smooth paste. While blending dal just use enough water needed to blend. I used about 3 tablespoons of water.</li>
            <li>After dal is blended to smooth paste add all the ingredients fennel seeds, cumin seeds, asafetida, and mango powder except oil, blend for few seconds making all the ingredients mix well.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a nonstick frying pan over low medium heat, add dal paste and keep stirring until it becomes consistency of soft dough. This should take about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and let it cool just enough that you can knead it to make a soft dough.</li>
            <li>Take the dough and knead it for a minutes. Divide the dough in 18 equal parts.</li>
            <li>Take the filling and divide into 18 parts, filling should be little smaller then dough ball. You may have some filling left over.</li>
            <li>Take one part of the dough and with your fingers flatten the edges and make into 3-inch circle. Leaving center little thicker then edges.</li>
            <li>Mold the dough into a cup and place 1 part of filling in the center. Pull the edges of the dough to wrap the dal filling. Proceed to make all the balls.</li>
            <li>Let the filled ball sit for three to four minutes before rolling.</li>
            <li>Lightly Oil the rolling pin and rolling surface. Roll the balls gently into 6” circles.</li>
            <li>You can roll two or three puris before start frying, but do not roll all the puris at once or they will begin to dry out and fail to puff.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in frying pan over medium heat frying pan should have about one inch of oil. To check if oil is ready put a little piece of dough in the oil. Dough should sizzle, and come up slowly.</li>
            <li>Fry one puri at a time. Place the puri in the frying pan and press with a skimmer. The puri should puff up. Turn puri over and cook until light golden brown on both sides. Take the puri out and place them on paper towels to absorb the excess oil. Repeat the process for remaining piries.</li>
