        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups carrot shredded</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>1/3 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons clarified butter or ghee</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped cashews to garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Use a nonstick or heavy bottom frying pan to make a seviyan kheer. Add the seviyan and roast them for about two minutes on medium low heat.</li>
            <li>Add the milk and increase the heat to medium high. After milk comes to boil reduce the heat to medium. Let the milk boil for about 30 minutes, until the milk is creamy and reduced to almost half. Stir often to ensure the milk does not burn in the bottom of the pan, and also keep scraping the sides of the frying pan.</li>
            <li>Add the sugar, saffron, cardamom, nutmeg, and almonds. Let the seviyan kheer simmer over low heat for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>As seviyan kheer cools it will become thicker in texture.</li>
            <li>Garnish with pistachios. Seviyan can be served chilled or warm.</li>
        </ul>
